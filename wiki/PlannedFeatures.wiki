#summary A list of features yet to come

This list will be expanded once I wrap my head around what my plans and goals with this engine really are.

== Short term goals ==

 * Saving/loading the current state of the game (position, progress, global variables, etc.)
 * Animated tiles

== Long term goals ==

 * Live action combat system (take Zelda for example)
